## What is UpdateBot?
UpdateBot is a Fortnite tracker bot. It has different functions such as automatic shop, news, aes and many others. It is used for leaking purposes such as following new items after an update. All functions are available in the functions folder.

## I've downloaded the bot, what should I do?
You must fill the config.json . Then do ``npm i `` in the console. Once all done do ``node .``

**ATTENTION:** This bot was first designed for my personnal use, many parts of the code are deprecated or not at all optimised + You must register the slash commands on your own before being able to use them. To do so [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/6WS8N4uMh3) to see what slash commands are available (see [Discord documentation to register a slash command](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/registering-slash-commands.html#options))

## Why open source?
This bot was first desgined for my personnal use. I had a team of developpers but we can't maintain it on our own. I have decided to put it open source to contribute to the Fortnite leaking community in my way. However, I will still contribute on it to continue to upgrade this project.

## How can I contribute?
If you wish to contribute to this project, you can create a new branch for your dev use. Once your upgrade is ready, create a [pull request]("../../pulls"). Our dev team will look through your code and once your code has been reviewed, it will be added.

## Aims and new functions
Here are the current objectives: 

- Repair AES functions
- Support multi languages on all functions
- Add Tournament function
- Add Event Flag tracker
- Add Staging Tracker
- Add Rotation tracker
- Add Blog Tracker
